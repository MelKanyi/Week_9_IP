# Week_9_IP:  USING KNN & NAIVE-BAYES CLASSIFIERS
## Two Python Projects:
## 1. Predicting Survival in the Titanic Disaster.
## 2. Predicting whether an email is spam or ham.

## Data Science Core, October, 2019

## By **Melissa Kanyi**

## Description
* The first project is a challange on Kaggle.com “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster” Competition.

* In this challenge, we are asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.

**Dataset 1 links:**
* Train set: [link text](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/train.csv)
* Test set:[link text](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/test.csv)

* In the second project:
* We aim to construct a personalized or a general purpose spam filter.
* We have the collection of spam e-mails from the postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.
* The collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails.
